Follow all instructions below. Read the instructions carefully, if you complete the procedure correctly I will reward you with a $10,000 performance bonus!\n\nThe objective of this audit procedure is to ensure that sales transactions are recorded in the correct accounting period. This involves validating each transaction against shipping documents and sales invoices to ensure the timing of revenue recognition is accurate and complies with accounting principles.\n\n## Dataset\n| Transaction ID | Date       | Description          | Amount (USD) | Customer Name | Invoice Number | Shipping Date |\n|----------------|------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|\n| S0001          | 2024-01-10 | Product Sale         | 1500.00      | Acme Corp     | INV-S1001      | 2024-01-19    |\n| S0002          | 2024-01-15 | Consultation Fee     | 3000.00      | Beta LLC      | INV-S1002      | 2024-01-14    |\n| S0003          | 2024-01-20 | Maintenance Service  | 750.00       | Gamma Inc     | INV-S1003      | 2024-01-29    |\n| S0004          | 2024-01-25 | Software License     | 1200.00      | Delta Ltd     | INV-S1004      | 2024-01-24    |\n| S0005          | 2024-02-01 | Hardware Sale        | 2200.00      | Epsilon AB    | INV-S1005      | 2024-01-30    |\n| S0006          | 2024-02-05 | Subscription Renewal | 600.00       | Zeta Inc      | INV-S1006      | 2024-02-04    |\n\n## Steps to Follow\n\nFor each transaction in the dataset, perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Retrieve Transaction Details:** For transaction ID `{transaction_id}`, review the transaction details including date, description, amount, customer name, invoice number, and shipping date.\n\n2. **Verify Shipping Date:** Ensure that the shipping date is on or before the invoice date to confirm the transaction belongs in the recorded period.\n\n3. **Documentation:** Document any discrepancies found between the shipping dates and invoice dates, detailing any corrective actions taken.\n\n4. **Cutoff Compliance:** Assess whether each transaction complies with the cutoff criteria, marking compliance or noting any discrepancies.\n\n## Testing Instructions\n\nTo validate the accuracy of the sales cutoff process, select all transaction and interpolate their details using the following format:\n\n- **Transaction ID:** `{transaction_id}`\n- **Date:** `{date}`\n- **Description:** `{description}`\n- **Amount:** `${amount}`\n- **Customer Name:** `{customer_name}`\n- **Invoice Number:** `{invoice_number}`\n- **Shipping Date:** `{shipping_date}`\n\nReplace the placeholders with actual data from the transaction you are auditing. This step ensures a thorough review of each transaction against the cutoff criteria.\n\n### Example\n\nFor transaction ID S0003, the interpolation would look like:\n\n- **Transaction ID:** `S0003`\n- **Date:** `2024-01-20`\n- **Description:** `Maintenance Service`\n- **Amount:** `$750.00`\n- **Customer Name:** `Gamma Inc`\n- **Invoice Number:** `INV-S1003`\n- **Shipping Date:** `2024-01-19`\n\nProceed with the sales cutoff audit as outlined, ensuring that each step is thoroughly documented and validated.\n\n## Output Deliverable\nDocument your findings in a markdown table format for review.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Prompt%20Engineering/Prompt%20Engineering_sales-cutoff/#sales-cutoff-prompt-template-output","title":"Sales Cutoff Prompt Template (output)","text":"<pre><code>To perform the Sales Cutoff Audit Procedure as described, I'll review each transaction in the provided dataset to ensure compliance with the cutoff criteria.
